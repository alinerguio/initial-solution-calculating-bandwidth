# Initial Solution Calculating Bandwidth

This code was written in Python, using the IDE Jupyter. Also, were used SuiteSpare matrixes to test the algortirthm. The code was divided in four functions, which will be described in the next topics. 

## Initial Solution
This initial solution was based on the inicial solution of the article Variable neighbourhood search for bandwidth reduction by Nenad Mladenovic, Dragan Urosevic, Dionisio Pérez-Brito, Carlos G. García-González, with some adaptations. This initial solution is based on the VNS methodology, being basically a depth-first-search with randomness. It returns the new labels of the vertexs in the graph for it to have a smaller bandwidth. 

## Create Adjacency List
This funcion creates a adjacency list based on the matrix archives obtained in SuitsSpare. It was needed because the Initial Solution uses a adjecency list as a parameter. 

## Labelling Adjacency List
This funcion uses the new labels, generated by the initial solution, and the original adjacency list. The result is the new graph with new labels. 


## Calculate Bandwidth
This function calculates the bandwidth of a graph, using a adjacency list. This was used to calculate the graph's bandwidth before and after the initial solution.
